 - Chat System now has a fully customizable language filter
   - In the inspector, add words, or regular expressions of words to the Word Filters. 2 examples are provided. If you need help with regular expressions, a good free online tool to help test them is here: http://www.regexpal.com/
   - Each filter can be configured to be case sensitive, or not.
 - Chat System now supports Commands
   - Each command is accessible by typing /[name of command]. In the demo scene there are 3 commands configured. 
     - /help to print help
	 - /all to change chat message target to all chat
	 - /team to change chat message target to current user's team chat.
   - In the Inspector you can configure what each command does with the native Unity Editor controls.
   - Please note that the user must press enter to submit a command. If CallFunctionThenSendMessage = true, the message will still be sent after FunctionToCall.Invoke() is called. This is useful for scenarios such as /team hello team to send the message to team chat if the Chat System was first opened with the intention to send a message to all chat.
     - For example, typing "/team hello team" should send "hello team" to my current team chat. and "/all hello all" should send "hello all" to the all chat channel if this is set to true.

 - Chat System allows direct adding/editing of Channels in the Editor. Simply set the number of desired channels, name them, and give them a channel (uint), and a Color.
 - Chat Message prefab no longer uses separate Sender Name and Message text components. Using rich text the channel color is assigned to the name, and message is appended after that.
   - This also allows long names and messages to display in a more fluid nature
 - Ensures latest chat message is displayed when scrolling occurs.
 - Add option to prevent showing chat on message received in case you want user to always have to manually open chat
 - Input Placeholder informs user which channel they will be typing to. 
	- Note that an upgrade to 5.4 will be required for best results. There is an undesirable effect of clearing the placeholder text when user selects inputfield, so they cannot read this placeholder
 - More advanced feature: Give some samples + framework for optional performance improvements (do not always search for players, instead cache them locally)
